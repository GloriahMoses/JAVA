Lab2 Assignment - Tasks (Individual) 

1.	 Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input and display the product of two numbers.  
Test Data:
Input first number: 25
Input second number: 5
Expected Output :
25 x 5 = 125

2.	Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.  
Test Data:
Input first number: 125
Input second number: 24
Expected Output :
125 + 24 = 149
125 - 24 = 101
125 x 24 = 3000
125 / 24 = 5
125 mod 24 = 5

3.	Write a Java program to compare two numbers. It should display a message indicating whether or not they are equal.
Input Data:
Input first integer: 25
Input second integer: 39

4.	Write a Java program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius degree. 
Test Data
Input a degree in Fahrenheit: 212
Expected Output:
212.0 degree Fahrenheit is equal to 100.0 in Celsius

5.	Write a Java program that accepts two integers from the user and then prints the sum, the difference, the product, the average, the distance (the difference between integer), the maximum (the larger of the two integers), the minimum (smaller of the two integers).  
Test Data
Input 1st integer: 25 
Input 2nd integer: 5
Expected Output :
Sum of two integers: 30
Difference of two integers: 20
Product of two integers: 125
Average of two integers: 15.00
Distance of two integers: 20
Max integer: 25 
Min integer: 5
